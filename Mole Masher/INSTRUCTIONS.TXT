Welcome to Mole Masher!
This is a game designed and coded by Peter West.
Please note that the program works best^
on 1280x1024 screen dimensions.
On starting the game you will be welcomed by the start-up screen.
This has options for ending the program (File - Quit)^ 
viewing instructions (Help - Instructions)^
viewing the High Score League Table (High Scores - View Table)^
and progressing through the game to the next stage 'Enter Your Details'.
After clicking the 'Enter Your Details' button^
enter you name with a space between each name and click 'Submit'.
You then will be presented with a level selection screen.
Choose a level to start the game on (1-5)^
the game will progress through each level^
until it reaches the end of level 5.
You can keep track of your current score^
in the score window under the main game.
Your score is the number of hits^
Multiplied by the level of difficulty^
and with the number of misses subtracted.
Each level is completed when the mole has moved 50 times.
The game adapts itself to relate to the date^
with the mole modifying itself for Christmas and Easter time.
